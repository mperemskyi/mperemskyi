<summary> More staff about me</summary>

I completed a course at TechMission - Academy of IT Education specializing in Manual QA Engineer. 
I gained knowledge in testing and quality control. The practical tasks helped me to understand how to write test cases, checklists, conduct testing, detect prioritization, find bugs, and to gather that data in Jira system. 
As for now I have:
* Knowledge of types and levels of testing, principles of testing
* Understanding the role of testing in software development
* Understanding of the SDLC and STLC, Bug's Life Cycle
* Understanding of Agile frameworks (Scrum, Kanban)
* Practice of working with DevTools (JSON, XML)
* Knowledge and practice of mobile testing (Fiddler)
* Knowledge of a client-server model (HTTP(s), REST, SOAP)
* Basic knowledge of working with databases, SQL (SQLite), API testing (Postman), HTML/HTML5 and CSS/CSS3, JavaScript

In the HR Admin Specialist position, I received tasks from various areas ranging from asset purchases to GUS reporting. Based on my previous work experience, I implemented the process of legalizing employees from the very beginning inside the company, and as a result I developed my professional skills significantly. I learned not to be afraid of responsibility, to be straightforward and learned the ways to improve the quality of my work. Scrupulousness in working with documents, communication with the team and the ability to hear their opinions helped me to find vulnerabilities, and therefore improve processes inside the company. 
My goal is to transfer all these experiences to a new area, where I can continue my development path while contributing to the improvement of products and processes in the new industry. 

I like to meet new people, talk about blockchain and new technologies, read articles about economy and programming (especially Python language)
